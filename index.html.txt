About
	•	I am now a full professor with tenure in the School of Computer Science in Peking University. I obtained my Ph.D. from Peking University in 2006. I had been a visiting associate professor at Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of Stanford University in 2013-2014. My current research mainly concerns applications of probabilistic methods for machine learning, including Program Language Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Software Engineering.
